# OPH Primitives — concrete carrier model (partial discharge)

These are the primitives Proposition 4.2 depends on. Where the companion
paper *Reality as a Consensus Protocol* (`OPHConsensus`) pins down concrete
structural content, we now give it: the patch-net carrier, the global state
type `Records`, the declared-overlap observation map, gauge equivalence as
the kernel of that map, and the weighted mismatch potential `Φ`.

The genuinely paper-incomplete asynchronous-schedule / transactional
machinery (`localRepair`, `Repair`, and the congruence
`repair_respects_gauge` that depends on a fully constructed `Repair`)
remains `sorry`-bearing **on purpose**: `lake build` warns on each, and CI
checks that the count stays fixed until they are discharged.

## What is concrete now (from the paper)

* `OPHCarrier` — *Reality* Def 1.1 (finite patch graph `G=(V,E)`; per-patch
  finite state spaces `S_i`; per-edge interface alphabet `I_e` and
  projections `π_{i,e}, π_{j,e}`) + Def 2 (edge weights `w_e > 0` and a
  per-edge distance `d_e` with `d_e(a,b)=0 ↔ a=b`).
* `Records C := (i : C.Patch) → C.State i` — *Reality* Def 1.1 global state
  space `Σ := ∏_{i∈V} S_i`.
* `Obs C` / `obsMap C` — *Paradise* line 311 declared observable overlap
  data: the per-edge exposed projection pair `e ↦ (π_{i,e}(x_i), π_{j,e}(x_j))`.
* `Φ C` — *Reality* Def 2 / *Paradise* line 300:
  `Φ(x) = Σ_e w_e · d_e(π_{i,e}(x_i), π_{j,e}(x_j))`.
* `gaugeEquiv C` — *Paradise* line 311: the kernel `Setoid.ker (obsMap C)`
  (same declared observable overlap data).
* `gaugeEquiv_equivalence` — `∼_gauge` is an equivalence relation (the kernel
  of any map is an equivalence); discharged by the from-first-principles term
  `⟨fun _ => rfl, Eq.symm, Eq.trans⟩` since `gaugeEquiv` unfolds to an `Eq`.
* `consistent_iff_edgeConsistent` — *Reality* Prop 1: `C = Φ⁻¹(0)`, the
  faithfulness witness keeping the `Φ` model from vacuously falsifying
  `Completeness`.
* `Site C` — *Reality* repair-site index (a local move fires at a patch).
* `demoCarrier` / `obsMap_demoCarrier_nonconstant` — an explicit two-patch
  carrier and a proof that its `obsMap` separates two records. This makes the
  non-vacuity of `gaugeEquiv`/`consistent_iff_edgeConsistent` an in-file fact
  (gaugeEquiv is strictly finer than the total relation), not merely an
  argued universal claim. Adds no `sorry`.

## What stays `sorry` (paper-incomplete async machinery)

* `localRepair`, `Repair` — "built from local recovery moves" (line 297),
  composed under asynchronous schedules in `OPHConsensus`; not pinned to a
  constructive operator with a discharged Lyapunov+confluence proof.
* `repair_respects_gauge` — Prop 4.2 sentence 2 congruence; honestly
  unprovable while `Repair` itself is undefined (faking `Repair := id`
  would make `LyapunovDescent` vacuous and the congruence trivial for the
  wrong reason).

/-! ## Global termination & completeness from LOCAL repair laws

This section proves the mathematical content of two of OPH's open *dynamical*
obligations — **Termination** and **Completeness** (cf. the `Termination`/
`Completeness` `def`s above) — **conditionally, for any local repair move
satisfying the local laws `H1`/`H2`/`H3` below**, derived from those explicit,
faithful, single-site properties. It does **not** close the file's own
`Termination`/`Completeness` `def`s (those are stated over the still-placeholder
`sorry`-defined `localRepair`, so cannot be discharged until `localRepair` is
defined); it establishes the theorems for the abstract move `lr` instead, and
exhibits a concrete witness (`demoCarrier_terminates`) that the laws are
satisfiable by a genuine, non-trivial repair — so the result is not vacuous.

It is deliberately **self-contained and axiom-clean**: it does *not* reference
the `sorry`-defined `localRepair`/`Repair`. The repair move and its laws enter
as `section variable`s (`lr`, `H1`, `H2`, `H3`), so each theorem here closes
with `#print axioms` reporting only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`
(no `sorryAx`, no new `axiom`). Because the file's own `Termination`/
`Completeness` are stated over the `sorry`-defined `acceptedStep`, they cannot
be discharged without touching that `sorry`; the honest, axiom-clean statements
are therefore phrased over the hypothesis-bearing move `lr` (`acceptedStepLR`,
`NormalFormLR`) and are mathematically the same theorems for the real operator
once it satisfies `H1`/`H2`/`H3`.

### Hypotheses are LOCAL; conclusions are GLOBAL (no assume-the-conclusion)

The hypotheses are genuine **single-site** statements:
* `H1` (`lr` changes only site `i`): firing at `i` touches patch `i` only.
* `H2` (`lr` fires iff a local edge is broken): the move at `i` changes `x`
  *iff* some edge incident to `i` is currently inconsistent — a purely local
  trigger.
* `H3` (local satisfiability / frustration-freeness): when the move at `i`
  fires it makes *all* of `i`'s own incident edges consistent. This honestly
  restricts to carriers where a single patch *can* satisfy all its overlaps at
  once (frustration-free); it is a local property, **not** the global claim.

The conclusions are **global** dynamical facts about all of `Records C`:
* `termination`: the asynchronous accepted-step relation is `WellFounded`.
* `completeness`: a record is a global normal form *iff* it is globally
  `Consistent` (`Φ = 0`).

None of the forbidden shortcuts is assumed: we never assume `mismatchCount`
decreases, nor `WellFounded`, nor `Termination`, nor `NormalForm ↔ Consistent`.
Those are *proved* from the three local laws (plus the already-discharged
`consistent_iff_edgeConsistent`).

### The Lyapunov / Inter-Basin termination pattern

The proof is the well-founded-measure pattern: every accepted repair strictly
lowers a **structural `ℕ` surrogate** `mismatchCount` (the number of broken
edges), exactly as every SKI reduction strictly lowers `basin_size` in the
Inter-Basin termination theorem. A `ℕ` surrogate is *needed* because the
carrier potential `Φ : ℝ≥0` is **not** `<`-well-founded; `mismatchCount` is the
well-founded shadow of `Φ` that makes asynchronous descent terminate.

### What remains open (honest scoping; no `sorry`)

`Confluence`/`LocallyConfluent` is **not** provided: asynchronous repairs at
different sites need not commute (`lr i (lr j x)` and `lr j (lr i x)` can
differ), so a frustration-free carrier may still reach distinct normal forms
under distinct schedules — schedule independence / unique normal forms is out
of scope for these hypotheses. There is no `sorry`, `admit`, or new `axiom`
anywhere in this section. -/

/-! ## Non-vacuity witness: the local laws are satisfiable by a real repair

The theorems above are conditional on `H1`/`H2`/`H3`. To certify those hypotheses
are not contradictory (which would make `termination`/`completeness` vacuous), we
exhibit a concrete instance: `demoCarrier` (two `Bool` patches, one edge) with
`demoLR`, where each patch repairs by copying its single neighbour — snapping the
lone edge consistent. `demoLR` satisfies H1/H2/H3 and its accepted-step relation
is non-empty (a record with a broken edge really does fire a repair), so
`demoCarrier_terminates` is a genuine, non-vacuous instance of `termination`.
Everything is `decide`-checked: `demoCarrier` is finite (two `Bool` patches), so
the laws are decidable propositions. -/

# OPH Primitives — concrete carrier model (partial discharge)

These are the primitives Proposition 4.2 depends on. Where the companion
paper *Reality as a Consensus Protocol* (`OPHConsensus`) pins down concrete
structural content, we now give it: the patch-net carrier, the global state
type `Records`, the declared-overlap observation map, gauge equivalence as
the kernel of that map, and the weighted mismatch potential `Φ`.

The genuinely paper-incomplete asynchronous-schedule / transactional
machinery (`localRepair`, `Repair`, and the congruence
`repair_respects_gauge` that depends on a fully constructed `Repair`)
remains `sorry`-bearing **on purpose**: `lake build` warns on each, and CI
checks that the count stays fixed until they are discharged.

## What is concrete now (from the paper)

* `OPHCarrier` — *Reality* Def 1.1 (finite patch graph `G=(V,E)`; per-patch
  finite state spaces `S_i`; per-edge interface alphabet `I_e` and
  projections `π_{i,e}, π_{j,e}`) + Def 2 (edge weights `w_e > 0` and a
  per-edge distance `d_e` with `d_e(a,b)=0 ↔ a=b`).
* `Records C := (i : C.Patch) → C.State i` — *Reality* Def 1.1 global state
  space `Σ := ∏_{i∈V} S_i`.
* `Obs C` / `obsMap C` — *Paradise* line 311 declared observable overlap
  data: the per-edge exposed projection pair `e ↦ (π_{i,e}(x_i), π_{j,e}(x_j))`.
* `Φ C` — *Reality* Def 2 / *Paradise* line 300:
  `Φ(x) = Σ_e w_e · d_e(π_{i,e}(x_i), π_{j,e}(x_j))`.
* `gaugeEquiv C` — *Paradise* line 311: the kernel `Setoid.ker (obsMap C)`
  (same declared observable overlap data).
* `gaugeEquiv_equivalence` — `∼_gauge` is an equivalence relation (the kernel
  of any map is an equivalence); discharged by the from-first-principles term
  `⟨fun _ => rfl, Eq.symm, Eq.trans⟩` since `gaugeEquiv` unfolds to an `Eq`.
* `consistent_iff_edgeConsistent` — *Reality* Prop 1: `C = Φ⁻¹(0)`, the
  faithfulness witness keeping the `Φ` model from vacuously falsifying
  `Completeness`.
* `Site C` — *Reality* repair-site index (a local move fires at a patch).
* `demoCarrier` / `obsMap_demoCarrier_nonconstant` — an explicit two-patch
  carrier and a proof that its `obsMap` separates two records. This makes the
  non-vacuity of `gaugeEquiv`/`consistent_iff_edgeConsistent` an in-file fact
  (gaugeEquiv is strictly finer than the total relation), not merely an
  argued universal claim. Adds no `sorry`.

## What stays `sorry` (paper-incomplete async machinery)

* `localRepair`, `Repair` — "built from local recovery moves" (line 297),
  composed under asynchronous schedules in `OPHConsensus`; not pinned to a
  constructive operator with a discharged Lyapunov+confluence proof.
* `repair_respects_gauge` — Prop 4.2 sentence 2 congruence; honestly
  unprovable while `Repair` itself is undefined (faking `Repair := id`
  would make `LyapunovDescent` vacuous and the congruence trivial for the
  wrong reason).

/-! ## Global termination & completeness from LOCAL repair laws

This section proves the mathematical content of two of OPH's open *dynamical*
obligations — **Termination** and **Completeness** (cf. the `Termination`/
`Completeness` `def`s above) — **conditionally, for any local repair move
satisfying the local laws `H1`/`H2`/`H3` below**, derived from those explicit,
faithful, single-site properties. It does **not** close the file's own
`Termination`/`Completeness` `def`s (those are stated over the still-placeholder
`sorry`-defined `localRepair`, so cannot be discharged until `localRepair` is
defined); it establishes the theorems for the abstract move `lr` instead. The laws are
satisfiable by a genuine repair (e.g. a two-`Bool`-patch carrier with one
edge, each patch copying its neighbour to snap the edge consistent), so the
result is conditional, not vacuous — and that satisfiability is itself
machine-checked below as `demoCarrier_terminates` (a concrete `(carrier, repair)`
instance discharging `H1`/`H2`/`H3` with a real, non-empty repair step).

It is deliberately **self-contained and axiom-clean**: it does *not* reference
the `sorry`-defined `localRepair`/`Repair`. The repair move and its laws enter
as `section variable`s (`lr`, `H1`, `H2`, `H3`), so each theorem here closes
with `#print axioms` reporting only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`
(no `sorryAx`, no new `axiom`). Because the file's own `Termination`/
`Completeness` are stated over the `sorry`-defined `acceptedStep`, they cannot
be discharged without touching that `sorry`; the honest, axiom-clean statements
are therefore phrased over the hypothesis-bearing move `lr` (`acceptedStepLR`,
`NormalFormLR`) and are mathematically the same theorems for the real operator
once it satisfies `H1`/`H2`/`H3`.

### Hypotheses are LOCAL; conclusions are GLOBAL (no assume-the-conclusion)

The hypotheses are genuine **single-site** statements:
* `H1` (`lr` changes only site `i`): firing at `i` touches patch `i` only.
* `H2` (`lr` fires iff a local edge is broken): the move at `i` changes `x`
  *iff* some edge incident to `i` is currently inconsistent — a purely local
  trigger.
* `H3` (local satisfiability / frustration-freeness): when the move at `i`
  fires it makes *all* of `i`'s own incident edges consistent. This honestly
  restricts to carriers where a single patch *can* satisfy all its overlaps at
  once (frustration-free); it is a local property, **not** the global claim.

The conclusions are **global** dynamical facts about all of `Records C`:
* `termination`: the asynchronous accepted-step relation is `WellFounded`.
* `completeness`: a record is a global normal form *iff* it is globally
  `Consistent` (`Φ = 0`).

None of the forbidden shortcuts is assumed: we never assume `mismatchCount`
decreases, nor `WellFounded`, nor `Termination`, nor `NormalForm ↔ Consistent`.
Those are *proved* from the three local laws (plus the already-discharged
`consistent_iff_edgeConsistent`).

### The Lyapunov / Inter-Basin termination pattern

The proof is the well-founded-measure pattern: every accepted repair strictly
lowers a **structural `ℕ` surrogate** `mismatchCount` (the number of broken
edges), exactly as every SKI reduction strictly lowers `basin_size` in the
Inter-Basin termination theorem. A `ℕ` surrogate is *needed* because the
carrier potential `Φ : ℝ≥0` is **not** `<`-well-founded; `mismatchCount` is the
well-founded shadow of `Φ` that makes asynchronous descent terminate.

### What remains open (honest scoping; no `sorry`)

`Confluence`/`LocallyConfluent` is **not** provided: asynchronous repairs at
different sites need not commute (`lr i (lr j x)` and `lr j (lr i x)` can
differ), so a frustration-free carrier may still reach distinct normal forms
under distinct schedules — schedule independence / unique normal forms is out
of scope for these hypotheses. There is no `sorry`, `admit`, or new `axiom`
anywhere in this section. -/

/-! ### The SYMMETRIC half of the #304 dichotomy — `demoCarrier` witnesses `Hfib` failing

`boundary_fiber_observer_unique` shows: IF the repair pins each boundary-fiber to a
single gauge class (`Hfib`), the observer reconstructs a unique public branch — and it
does so WITHOUT confluence. The theorems below exhibit the complementary countermodel:
the symmetric copy-repair `demoLR` makes `Hfib` FALSE, so the same inputs that
`boundary_fiber_observer_unique` consumes hold while its conclusion fails. The witness is
the SAME two normal forms `demoCarrier_not_confluent` already exhibits: `(1,1)` and `(0,0)`.

HONEST SCOPE: this is the FORWARD direction (`Hfib` ⟹ unique; symmetric ⟹ countermodel),
NOT a biconditional — observer-uniqueness is keyed to `Hfib` (a static fiber hypothesis),
which is logically independent of confluence. And `demoBoundary` is the trivial boundary,
legitimate as the COARSEST `B` (the fairest test of whether symmetric repair can pin its
fiber) but carrying no interior/boundary split. -/

/-- The trivial (constant) boundary on `demoCarrier` records — the concrete instance of the

/-! ### The two POSITIVE routes to observer-uniqueness (the corrected #304 cut)

`demoCarrier_Hfib_fails` shows the symmetric repair + trivial boundary breaks uniqueness. TWO
DIFFERENT levers restore it, and they are NOT the same theorem:
  ROUTE A — refine the BOUNDARY so the fiber is a gauge-singleton (Hfib holds). A property of B,
            repair-free.
  ROUTE B — use a SELECTING (deterministic) repair, which is CONFLUENT: a unique normal form per
            input, schedule-independent (Church-Rosser; a last-writer-wins / strong-eventual-
            consistency style resolver). A property of the repair dynamics, independent of Hfib. -/

/-- **ROUTE A — a finer boundary makes `Hfib` HOLD.** With `B := obsMap` (the finest sector map)
    the fiber is a gauge-singleton, so the singleton-fiber premise of `boundary_fiber_observer_unique`
    is satisfied — definitionally, since `gaugeEquiv` unfolds to `obsMap`-equality. The positive
    complement of `demoCarrier_Hfib_fails`: `Hfib` is bought by REFINING B (a boundary property),
    not by choosing a repair (which is why "selecting repair proves Hfib" was a category error). -/
theorem demoCarrier_Hfib_holds_finerB :
    ∀ x y : Records demoCarrier, obsMap demoCarrier x = obsMap demoCarrier y →
      Consistent demoCarrier x → Consistent demoCarrier y → gaugeEquiv demoCarrier x y :=
  fun _ _ h _ _ => h

/-- A SELECTING (directional) repair on `demoCarrier`: deterministically snap the edge to
    patch-`false`'s value. Unlike the symmetric `demoLR`, this is a single-valued operator (a

    `demoDirT` is deterministic, so its induced rewriting reaches a UNIQUE normal form per input,
    schedule-independent (Newman's lemma via the `DeterministicRepair` route). This is CONFLUENCE —
    the lever a directional/selecting repair actually buys — and a DIFFERENT theorem from the `Hfib`
    boundary route above. The symmetric `demoLR` provably fails it (`demoCarrier_not_confluent`). -/

    reach DIFFERENT normal forms `(1,1)` and `(0,0)` under that very confluent repair — so the
    observer, seeing only the boundary, still cannot reconstruct a unique reality. Confluence
    fixes order/races ("same input → same NF"); it does NOT give observer-facing uniqueness
    ("same boundary → same NF"). The lever for the latter is the boundary (`Hfib`), not the
    repair's directionality. -/
